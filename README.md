# Advent of Code 2021

## What's this repo all about?

Well, this is a collection of code written in Golang to solve the daily problems presented
in [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). You'll find a directory for each day that contains a `main.go`
file and the inputs for that day.

## What's the strategy for solving these problems?

Well, to be blunt, I'm only really writing enough code to solve the problems presented. I'm not concerned too much with
efficiency or handling every single potential edge case. What I do care about is keeping myself sane while trying to
solve the problem, and so the code will probably be organized and kept as simple as possible to understand (for me at
least).

I'll probably refactor my code after getting the right answer just enough to be *not too messy*. But that would be about
it.
